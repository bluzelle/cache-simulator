Node distribution model(s)
Client access models
cache selection
measure results
quantify what is not accurately simulated

We can cheat for how caches are discovered, and take an average to determine what the closest non cache source woul dbe
We can also think about everything as only steady state, and measure how close clients are to their respective caches at the end of the simulation
