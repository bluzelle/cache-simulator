Add every statistic that seems useful
  Think about what we're going to want to ask. What do we need to ask those questions?

Then run the most realistic simulation I can, and present the conclusions.

Quantify what is not accurately simulated
  - steady state
Prepare to talk about it

parameterize
multithreading?

Conclusions:
  - this is a "continually running" thing, not a spur of the moment thing
