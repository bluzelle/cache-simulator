Extract more statistics
and output them somewhere

Plan is to run the best sim or set of sims I can over the weekend; get a script for it so I can run it overnight

Quantify what is not accurately simulated
  - steady state
Prepare to talk about it

parameterize
multithreading?

Conclusions:
  - this is a "continually running" thing, not a spur of the moment thing
